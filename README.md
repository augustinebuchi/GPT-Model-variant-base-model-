# GPT-Model-variant-base-model-
This GPT base model, created for my CV, is a starting point due to limited computational power on my CPU-based laptop. While I couldn't complete the full training process, it's designed for text generation and serves as a foundation. Users can modify it, including the number of decoder layers, to enhance performance.
