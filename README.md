 GPT Base Model

 Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of a base model for Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). The code serves as a foundational framework for text generation tasks and offers flexibility for customization to suit specific use cases and requirements.

NOTE: Due to convenience and limited computational power on my current device, I was unable to run the code provided directly. However, it's worth noting that the code was successfully executed on a previous device, yielding promising results. Prior to uploading the code to the cloud, it underwent rigorous testing and validation to ensure its functionality and effectiveness.

 Key Features

- Model Architecture: The GPT model is implemented using PyTorch, comprising embeddings, positional encodings, transformer layers, and a fully connected layer for output logits.

- Training Process: The code includes a training loop with an AdamW optimizer and cross-entropy loss function for training the model on text data.

- Data Preprocessing: Text data is loaded from a file, preprocessed to lowercase, and tokenized using the GPT2Tokenizer from the Hugging Face Transformers library. It is then converted to PyTorch tensors for training.

 Usage

1. Installation: Ensure Python and PyTorch are installed on your system.

2. Clone Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Data Preparation: Replace the example text file with your dataset or use the provided one.

4. Training: Run the training script to train the GPT model on your text data.

5. Customization: Modify hyperparameters, model architecture, or training process as needed for your task.

 Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers library
